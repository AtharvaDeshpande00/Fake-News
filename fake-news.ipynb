He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.

The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.   \n\n  subject               date  fake  \n0    News  December 31, 2017     1  \n1    News  December 31, 2017     1  \n2    News  December 30, 2017     1  \n3    News  December 29, 2017     1  \n4    News  December 25, 2017     1  ","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>title</th>\n      <th>text</th>\n      <th>subject</th>\n      <th>date</th>\n      <th>fake</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year’s Eve Message; This is Disturbing</td>\n      <td>Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans a Happy New Year and leave it at that.

He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role.

The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.</td>\n      <td>News</td>\n      <td>December 25, 2017</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.utils import shuffle\ndf = pd.concat([df_fake, df_real], axis=0)\n\n# Shuffle the data\ndf = shuffle(df).reset_index(drop=True)\ndf.head()","execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":4,"data":{"text/plain":"                                                                                                                                         title  \\\n0                                                   History Channel Classification Of The 2016 Election Makes Trump Supporters Lose Their Sh*t   \n1  WOW!

like the facts one little bit.The 2016 Election was by far one of the most disappointing in American history, not to mention the most devastating to our democracy that will have far-reaching consequences.It is a proven fact that Russia meddled with our political process by hacking into the DNC with the goal of spreading propaganda to make Americans lose faith in the election process and to help Trump win so Putin could have a puppet in the White House.Well, Russia succeeded and Republicans apparently don t have a problem with it because their guy won, which means foreign powers can now interfere in our election.The History channel marked this as a first in American history and posted about it on Facebook.Of course, Trump supporters immediately threw a temper tantrum. Fake news,  one supporter bellowed.  No proof is provided. History channel please stick to history stories, there are plenty of them. The CIA and 17 other intelligence agencies concluded that Russia meddled in our election. That s more than enough proof. Plus, Trump was told about Russian hacking months ago and he only urged them to keep committing espionage against our country.Despite the evidence, conservatives viciously attacked History channel with all sorts of wild accusations and conspiracy theories smearing Democrats in defense of Russia.Trump supporters are clearly just as thin-skinned and allergic to facts as their dear leader is. But their hissy fits do not change the fact that Russia did interfere with our election by committing espionage against our country. And those conservatives who claim that our intelligence community is wrong because they also said Iraq had WMDs are also talking out of their asses. In reality Bush ignored the intelligence community when it told him that Iraq did NOT have weapons of mass destruction.Donald Trump is an illegitimate president-elect, and his supporters can t handle it.In the end, history will judge the 2016 Election and the next four years under Trump and both will be judged a complete disaster. Many years from now, the History channel will be airing specials dedicated to examining how Trump made us the laughingstock of the world and how Putin used Trump to prevent the United States from challenging Russian aggression. That s assuming the United States still exists in four years.Featured Image: Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Hey Robert Mueller! Do you care to find out which foreign leaders candidate Hillary Clinton spoke with during her campaign?  Because according to Hillary, she received  messages  from foreign leaders asking her if they can endorse her to stop Donald Trump from becoming President. I am already receiving messages from leaders. I m having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump.    Hillary Clinton, March, 2016Hmmm Is there a tape of candidate Donald Trump like the one of Hillary, where he admits to having discussions with foreign leaders about how to stop Hillary from becoming President?While speaking at a Democratic Presidential Townhall meeting in  Columbus, Ohio, in March of 2016, Hillary thought she was rather clever by attempting to make it appear as though Donald Trump was wildly unpopular with all of her foreign connections. It s too bad the media forgot about this clip:TREASON? Video surfaces of Hillary admitting she was in contact with foreign leaders interfering in our election! https://t.co/EHHTyC0sEU  Newt-Trump Fan Club (@NewtTrump) July 19, 2017   \n2  THIS IS MADDENING! We have a president and congress who do nothing but promote illegal entry into America TREASON! The Obama Administration has been releasing thousands of criminal illegal aliens onto our streets. In just the last three years, ICE released 86,288 criminal aliens.    Senator Jeff SessionsSenator Jeff Sessions questioning Thomas Homan, the Executive Associate Director, Enforcement And Removal Operations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Homan admits they find illegal aliens but cannot deport them because of President Obama, whose policies protect whole classes of illegal aliens.SESSIONS DELIVERS OPENING STATEMENT ON DECLINING DEPORTATIONS AND INCREASING CRIMINAL ALIEN RELEASES WASHINGTON U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and The National Interest, delivered the following statement on the Administration s actions that have resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of aliens removed from the United States over recent years, and thousands of otherwise removable aliens being released from custody: Thank you to everyone for being here today, and thank you to Senator Blumenthal for serving as ranking member.First I d like to extend my condolences to the Director of ICE, Sarah Salda a, and her family on their recent, tragic loss. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them during this difficult time.Throughout its tenure, the Obama Administration has made numerous public statements, issued multiple memoranda, and represented in testimony before Congress that it has limited resources and therefore can remove only a certain number and category of illegal aliens. Specifically, the Administration repeatedly claimed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had the resources to deport only approximately 400,000 illegal aliens from the United States each year.So, their reasoning went, they were compelled to focus on criminal illegal aliens and other aliens who pose threats to the country s security. Because of this focus, the President argued he had no choice but to grant executive amnesty to millions of illegal aliens   which would allow them to stay in the country and obtain work permits and other federal benefits.Yet, as we will examine in today s hearing, rather than truly prioritizing the removal of certain types of illegal aliens over others, the Obama Administration has simply refused to execute the laws passed by Congress and signed into law.It has ordered immigration law enforcement officers to ignore plain law and acquiesce to the presence of millions of illegal aliens in the United States, including criminals and those who have already been ordered deported to leave the country.If the Obama Administration was truly prioritizing the removal of certain illegal aliens over others, it would be reasonable to assume that with the same or more resources, the number of deportations would remain relatively steady each year.However, the simple fact is that since these policies were implemented, deportations have plummeted  particularly deportations from the interior of the country as opposed to the border   and most sharply under guidelines issued by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson in November 2014.As this dramatic decline has occurred, Congress has increased funding each year for the purpose of immigration enforcement.This is not prioritization and this is not prosecutorial discretion. This is a total refusal to carry out the laws passed by Congress that the Constitution obliges the President to faithfully execute.Meanwhile, the Obama Administration has been releasing thousands of criminal illegal aliens onto our streets. In just the last three years, ICE released 86,288 criminal aliens.At the same time, the Administration touts the decrease in the number of apprehensions at the border as a sign of border security. But as we will hear in testimony today, we simply do not apprehend every illegal alien who crosses the southern border. Not even close. Moreover, we are seeing near-record levels of certain categories of aliens   unaccompanied alien minors and family units   who face no chance of actually being deported under this Administration. This simply sends a message that anybody, anywhere in the world, if they can get into the United States across our southern border, for example, they will be allowed to stay in the country. Other than Mexico, they re allowed to stay in the country. And that is why so many are coming. It s not the law that s on the books, but the policies that are being carried out at our border. This is not how the immigration system was intended to work, it s not how the immigration system must work, this is a lawless policy and it has to be ended.So today s hearing will focus on a central claim the Obama Administration makes to excuse its lawless immigration policies   namely that limited resources compelled the implementation of its lawless immigration policies. We will also assess the impact of this lawlessness on the integrity, the very moral foundation of our immigration system. If it s not properly executed and carried out, it has no integrity and it lacks morality.This Administration for too long has been trying to hide from the American people the true nature of what it has been doing. Today, we will set the record straight. Efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity are essential in this government. The taxpayers don t spend money for ICE and the border patrol to have supervisors somehow keep the officers from doing their duty. Accountability is critical. Congress has a duty to ensure accountability of the agencies it supervises, and that is what we will do today.    \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Why is the NFL ignoring this situation?

The revelation was that Republican presidential candidate Donald trump may have manipulated his taxes to make it so that he has not had to pay income taxes for two decades. Now, Clinton is trolling Trump hard with a special tax calculator that shows exactly how much a person would pay in income taxes if they were Trump. The joke is pretty straightforward. Type in your annual income and the calculator shows the same amount of money owed in taxes is exactly $0. Clinton s campaign website also displays a message that reads: Donald Trump says it s because he s smart. The New York Times says it s because he lost almost a billion dollars. Either way, Donald Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years after losing $916 million in 1995. And Trump really did pay zero, or nearly zero, in federal income taxes in 1978, 1979, 1984, 1991, and 1993. Until we see evidence otherwise, we ll assume it s still zero. Clinton s campaign manager, Robby Mook just released a statement on the matter. In the statement Mook said that: He apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades while tens of millions of working families paid theirs. He calls that  smart. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, breaking decades worth of tradition. Most people on the left assumed he had something to hide. Now we have a bit more of an idea of what exactly he is hiding. Since the revelation, Trump has been lambasted by many individuals. Notably, Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, who said that Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father.  Reid also called for the passing of the Presidential Tax Transparency Act. The PTTA would make it mandatory for presidential candidates to release their tax returns if they seek the office of the presidency.Featured image from screenshot   \n\n           subject               date  fake  \n0             News  December 22, 2016     1  \n1         politics       Jul 23, 2017     1  \n2  Government News       May 20, 2016     1  \n3        left-news       Jul 13, 2016     1  \n4             News    October 2, 2016     1  ","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>title</th>\n      <th>text</th>\n      <th>subject</th>\n      <th>date</th>\n      <th>fake</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>History Channel Classification Of The 2016 Election Makes Trump Supporters Lose Their Sh*t</td>\n      <td>The History channel has spoken and Donald Trump s deplorable supporters didn t like the facts one little bit.The 2016 Election was by far one of the most disappointing in American history, not to mention the most devastating to our democracy that will have far-reaching consequences.It is a proven fact that Russia meddled with our political process by hacking into the DNC with the goal of spreading propaganda to make Americans lose faith in the election process and to help Trump win so Putin could have a puppet in the White House.Well, Russia succeeded and Republicans apparently don t have a problem with it because their guy won, which means foreign powers can now interfere in our election.The History channel marked this as a first in American history and posted about it on Facebook.Of course, Trump supporters immediately threw a temper tantrum. Fake news,  one supporter bellowed.  No proof is provided. History channel please stick to history stories, there are plenty of them. The CIA and 17 other intelligence agencies concluded that Russia meddled in our election. That s more than enough proof. Plus, Trump was told about Russian hacking months ago and he only urged them to keep committing espionage against our country.Despite the evidence, conservatives viciously attacked History channel with all sorts of wild accusations and conspiracy theories smearing Democrats in defense of Russia.Trump supporters are clearly just as thin-skinned and allergic to facts as their dear leader is. But their hissy fits do not change the fact that Russia did interfere with our election by committing espionage against our country. And those conservatives who claim that our intelligence community is wrong because they also said Iraq had WMDs are also talking out of their asses. In reality Bush ignored the intelligence community when it told him that Iraq did NOT have weapons of mass destruction.Donald Trump is an illegitimate president-elect, and his supporters can t handle it.In the end, history will judge the 2016 Election and the next four years under Trump and both will be judged a complete disaster. Many years from now, the History channel will be airing specials dedicated to examining how Trump made us the laughingstock of the world and how Putin used Trump to prevent the United States from challenging Russian aggression. That s assuming the United States still exists in four years.Featured Image: Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images</td>\n      <td>News</td>\n      <td>December 22, 2016</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>WOW!

We have a president and congress who do nothing but promote illegal entry into America TREASON! The Obama Administration has been releasing thousands of criminal illegal aliens onto our streets. In just the last three years, ICE released 86,288 criminal aliens.    Senator Jeff SessionsSenator Jeff Sessions questioning Thomas Homan, the Executive Associate Director, Enforcement And Removal Operations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Homan admits they find illegal aliens but cannot deport them because of President Obama, whose policies protect whole classes of illegal aliens.SESSIONS DELIVERS OPENING STATEMENT ON DECLINING DEPORTATIONS AND INCREASING CRIMINAL ALIEN RELEASES WASHINGTON U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and The National Interest, delivered the following statement on the Administration s actions that have resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of aliens removed from the United States over recent years, and thousands of otherwise removable aliens being released from custody: Thank you to everyone for being here today, and thank you to Senator Blumenthal for serving as ranking member.First I d like to extend my condolences to the Director of ICE, Sarah Salda a, and her family on their recent, tragic loss. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them during this difficult time.Throughout its tenure, the Obama Administration has made numerous public statements, issued multiple memoranda, and represented in testimony before Congress that it has limited resources and therefore can remove only a certain number and category of illegal aliens. Specifically, the Administration repeatedly claimed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had the resources to deport only approximately 400,000 illegal aliens from the United States each year.So, their reasoning went, they were compelled to focus on criminal illegal aliens and other aliens who pose threats to the country s security. Because of this focus, the President argued he had no choice but to grant executive amnesty to millions of illegal aliens   which would allow them to stay in the country and obtain work permits and other federal benefits.Yet, as we will examine in today s hearing, rather than truly prioritizing the removal of certain types of illegal aliens over others, the Obama Administration has simply refused to execute the laws passed by Congress and signed into law.It has ordered immigration law enforcement officers to ignore plain law and acquiesce to the presence of millions of illegal aliens in the United States, including criminals and those who have already been ordered deported to leave the country.If the Obama Administration was truly prioritizing the removal of certain illegal aliens over others, it would be reasonable to assume that with the same or more resources, the number of deportations would remain relatively steady each year.However, the simple fact is that since these policies were implemented, deportations have plummeted  particularly deportations from the interior of the country as opposed to the border   and most sharply under guidelines issued by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson in November 2014.As this dramatic decline has occurred, Congress has increased funding each year for the purpose of immigration enforcement.This is not prioritization and this is not prosecutorial discretion. This is a total refusal to carry out the laws passed by Congress that the Constitution obliges the President to faithfully execute.Meanwhile, the Obama Administration has been releasing thousands of criminal illegal aliens onto our streets. In just the last three years, ICE released 86,288 criminal aliens.At the same time, the Administration touts the decrease in the number of apprehensions at the border as a sign of border security. But as we will hear in testimony today, we simply do not apprehend every illegal alien who crosses the southern border. Not even close. Moreover, we are seeing near-record levels of certain categories of aliens   unaccompanied alien minors and family units   who face no chance of actually being deported under this Administration. This simply sends a message that anybody, anywhere in the world, if they can get into the United States across our southern border, for example, they will be allowed to stay in the country. Other than Mexico, they re allowed to stay in the country. And that is why so many are coming. It s not the law that s on the books, but the policies that are being carried out at our border. This is not how the immigration system was intended to work, it s not how the immigration system must work, this is a lawless policy and it has to be ended.So today s hearing will focus on a central claim the Obama Administration makes to excuse its lawless immigration policies   namely that limited resources compelled the implementation of its lawless immigration policies. We will also assess the impact of this lawlessness on the integrity, the very moral foundation of our immigration system. If it s not properly executed and carried out, it has no integrity and it lacks morality.This Administration for too long has been trying to hide from the American people the true nature of what it has been doing. Today, we will set the record straight. Efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity are essential in this government. The taxpayers don t spend money for ICE and the border patrol to have supervisors somehow keep the officers from doing their duty. Accountability is critical. Congress has a duty to ensure accountability of the agencies it supervises, and that is what we will do today.</td>\n      <td>Government News</td>\n      <td>May 20, 2016</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>#NFL TWEETS About Tom Brady’s Deflategate Appeal Denial…IGNORES Isaiah Crowell’s Image Of Cop’s Throat Being Slit On Social Media?</td>\n      <td>Why is the NFL ignoring this situation?
